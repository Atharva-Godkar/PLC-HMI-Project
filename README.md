## Highlights of the Project

| Tool        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![images.png](https://i.postimg.cc/jSnpBLrw/images.png) | Siemens Totall Integrated Automation (TIA) Portal is an engineering framework that integrates various automation software tools into one environment, facilitating PLC programming, HMI design, commissioning, and diagnostic within a single software suite. |
| ![smartdraw-logo-images.png](https://i.postimg.cc/76HQPLjN/smartdraw-logo-images.png) | While working on any industrial automation project, engineer has to create a power diagram and control diagram. Smart Draw is free online tool that helps us to make sofisticated power diagram. After that control diagrams are made on Siemens TIA Portal. |
